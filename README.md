**FusionCMS** is an open source, modern, intuitive, and flexible content management system (CMS) built on the Laravel framework developed in Seattle, WA by [efelle creative](https://seattlewebdesign.com).

Modular at heart, FusionCMS provides the necessary launching platform to build out any type of web or mobile application. It's intuitive and easy for content editors to use on a daily basis, while still maintaining the power and flexibility for developers and designers to dig into the heart of the platform to build and design whatever comes to mind.
